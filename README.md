created by Cera Smart

Here's how the site works:

This project utilizes the GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page that populates gifs in the category of Parks and Rec Characters.

When the user clicks on a button, the page retrieves 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it returns to the static image.

Under every gif, the rating is displayed (PG or G, provided by the GIPHY API).

In addition, there is a form that allows a user to input a word to be added to the gif array. Then the user's word is added to the other buttons and will retrieve the appropriate gifs when clicked.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The project fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with jQuery and JavaScript, with this assignment, I also began learning how to work with AJAX requests and the GIPHY API to write items dynamically to the DOM without a browser page refresh.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

Just push one of the preloaded buttons to retrieve 10 relevant gifs. Create your own button by inputting a word in the field and pushing "Fetch". Then push your new button to retrieve the gifs for your new button. The gifs are cleared with each new button push.
